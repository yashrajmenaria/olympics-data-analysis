Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical Olympic Games data. The goal is to uncover insights and trends about athletes, countries, and medals across both Summer and Winter Olympics.

Two datasets have been used:

athlete_events.csv → Contains detailed information about all athletes who have participated in the Olympics (till 2016 for summer and 2010 for winter olympics), including their demographics, sports, events, and medals.

noc_region.csv → Maps each National Olympic Committee (NOC) code to its corresponding region/country.

Analysis Performed

Using Python and data analysis libraries, the following aspects were explored:

1. Season-wise Medal Tally

Comparison of medal distribution between Summer and Winter Olympics.

2. Country-wise Medal Tally

Breakdown of total medals won by each country.

3. Year-wise Medal Tally

Tracking the number of medals awarded in each edition of the Olympics for each country

4. Year-wise Progress of Countries

Observing growth trends over time for each country for both seasons
